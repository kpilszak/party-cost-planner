## General info
This project is a Windows Forms Application.  
The main purpose is to plan costs of party.   
There are two kinds of parties you can choose from: occasional event or birthday party.  
The costs of occasional event depend on guests number, sort of drinks and decorations.  
While the costs of birthday party depend on guests number, decorations, size of a cake and length of the cake's inscription. On birthday party there is not only soft drinks opion.  
  
The rules of fee amount are as follow:
* 25$ per person
* 100$ additional fee if the guests number exceedes 12 persons
* 20$ per person for alcohol, if only soft drinks will be served - 5$ per person + 5% discount on the party price
* 30$ decorations fee + 7.50$ per person, but if the decorations are fanciful the costs are 50$ fee + 15$ per person 
* 40$ cake fee or 75$ cake fee if the guests number > 4
